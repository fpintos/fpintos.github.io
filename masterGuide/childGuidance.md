# Child Guidance

Child Guidance, by Ellen White, repeats and expands many of the concepts found in her book Education, providing guidance and practical examples directed to both parents and children. This should not be surprising, since the book is a compilation, with many references to Education and other manuscripts.

The central theme of the book, as it happens with many others from Ellen White, is that we should build - on ourselves and on our children - a Christ-like character. A character formed according to divine likeness is the only thing we can take from this world, and that includes the power of will and the power of self-control.

Temperance and balance are key, so the character will be well formed. *"...many err upon the side of indulgence; others go to the opposite extreme and rule their children with a rod of iron. Neither of these follow out the Bible directions." (CG,175).*

The lack of restrain, negligence with small details of life and indulgence of any type of sin are brought to attention and portrayed as great impediments to the proper education and formation of character.

As one reads, one might be tempted to think that it would be impossible for someone to "follow all these rules". It is when we understand that it is not by our human power that we would do so that one can fully comprehend to scope of the work. As Jesus said, what is impossible to men, is possible to God. Only when we truly give ourselves to God and let His will rule our life and our desired is when we will be in a position to be truly educated, and to put forth the kind of guidance that our children deserve.
