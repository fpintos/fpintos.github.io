# Pathfinders Interactions

While working as a Pathfinder counselor in the Sojourners club I was able to watch the interactions of the kids in many different occasions.

As a general rule, most of the kids are excited to participate in the club meetings and activities. They are very inclusive and supportive of each other and are ready to collaborate with staff members as the programs develop during the regular meetings and campouts, although, as one might expect from kids in their age, sometimes the group only comes together as one when called into attention.

In this group we've been fortunate that there has hardly been any kind of difficult trouble between them or with staff members, at least that has come to my attention.

It is also possible to identify kids that fit the following patterns:
- The trouper: many of the kids in the club are ready to work and to help in whatever is needed. They are usually the first ones to volunteer when help is requested and display an eager spirit to participate and complete the assigned tasks.
 
- Inattentive: some of the younger kids have a tendency to lose interest in the main program and might become distracted by their own thoughts or some prop or toy they might have with them. These usually require a gentle reminder to focus on the task at hand and maybe let go of the object of interest until the end of the meeting. 

- Unenthusiastic: it goes without saying that none should expect *all* kids to be excited about *everything*, but there are some kids in the group that show a significant lesser level of enthusiasm as the others when new activities are introduced. They do seem to enjoy the activities once they start and they are present and active in the programs, and I've never seen them complaining about anything, but there is definitively a feeling that perhaps they might want to be doing something else.

- Non-participant: some kids become non-participants in some of the activities, for different reasons. Some might not be interested in a particular game or a couple of them they might hide in a corner to chit-chat about something. In the case of honors and classes, staff and other members of the club will bring those back, but in the case of games, in particular the ones that require more physical activities, we usually let them do something different if they don't want to participate.

- The "loud" ones: in the group there is always some that are more expressive than the rest; the program provides times at which kids can express themselves and these will usually dominate the talk if we let them, but staff and the kids themselves seem to know to be fair and give different kids a chance to ask questions, request hymns, express ideas and so on.

The willingness and eagerness displayed by the Pathfinders of the Sojourners club makes it very fulfilling to work with them.
