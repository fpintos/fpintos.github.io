# Steps To Christ

The book Steps to Christ by Ellen G. White addresses several questions a person might have as one begins to know God and thuought one's life.

Based on biblical evidence, the book begins by establishing God as the creator, how nature and scripture reveals God's love for man, how a perfect creation was separated from God by sin, and the redemptive plan executed by God to restore man to his own image.

Man was created perfect but thru diobedience sin, death and selfishness have entered this world, taking the place of love. Human nature became so weakened that it was impossible for man alone to resist the power of evil. The Son of God came to manifest the Father and to provide a redemptive sacrifice. His work was to do good, heal the sick and preach the gospel of salvation, showing love, mercy and compassion. He took man's nature in order to reach man's wants. He was never rude and did not censure human weakness. He spoke the truth, always in love. Every soul was precious in His eyes.

His sacrifice was not made to make God love man, but *because* God loved man. None other but the Son of God could accomplish our redemption. He was one with God and linked Himself to the children of men. He is our Sacrifice, our Advocate, our Brother.

The price paid for our redemption declares how valuable is man to God. The more we stydy the love of God for a world that did not love Him the more we will learn about His character, about His mercy, tenderness, forgiveness, equity and justice. However, it is not enough to know about God - we need to develop an intimate relationship with God, so our character will become like Christ's.

The more we learn about God's love for us and the standard of character we should live by, the more we are convicted of our sinful state. What then shall we do? Repent and be converted. Repentance includes sorrow for sin and a turning away from it. This change has to happen from inside out. The old man needs to die and be born again, least we make a shallow outward reformation to avoid the suffering from sin, but without any actual change in character.

As we are convicted our our sins we should confess them to God, who is just and forgiving. True confession is always of a specific character and acknowledges particular sins. Some might be brought before God alone, others might be confessed to individuals who have suffered because of them and yet others might be of a public character and require a public confession. Sincere confession and repentace will be followed by decided changes in the life. Tho whole heart must be yeilded to God and we will be restored to His likeness. This is not a blind submission, but an appeal to reason, intellect and conscience. We must give up all that separates us from Him, considering that Christ gave everything for us. By yielding up our will to Christ, we ally with the power that is above all powers. We should then believe that God forgives our sins and makes us whole. Jesus promissed that when we pray in His name and according to the will of the Father, we will receive it. His will is to cleanse us from sin, to make us His children and to live a holy life.

Many do no believe that Jesus pardons them personally, individually. They do not take God at His word and think they must earn the right to be blessed. This is a mistake. We should put away any suspicion that God's promisses do not apply to us. Look up to Jesus and have faith in that He makes intercession for us and His sacrifice was enough to pay the price of our sins.

One might not be able to tell exactly when conversion happens. The experience changes from person to person. The character is revealed, not by occasional good deeds and occasional misdeeds, but by the tendency of the habitual words and acts. If we are Christ's, then our thoughts are with Him and sweetest thoughts are of Him. All we have and are is consecrated to Him. The evidence of genuine repentance is reformation. Duty and sacrifice become a delight. But we should guard that we do not try to keep the law on our own or that we fall in the error of thinking that Christ released man from keeping the law. Obedience is not a means of salvation but a result of it. When the divine love is implanted in our soul, obedience to the law of God is the natural result.

The condition of eternal life is now the same as it has ever been - perfect righteouness and obedience to the law of God. Before the fall it was possible for Adam to form a righteous character, but once sin was introduced in the human nature we cannot make ourselves righteous. But Christ has made a way of escape. He lived on Earth amid the same trials and temptations such as we and yet He did not sin. He died for us and gave us His righteouness. Christ's character stands in place of our character and we are accepted before God as if we had not sinned. Christ changes the heart and as long as we maintain this connection by faith He will work in us according to His pleasure.
