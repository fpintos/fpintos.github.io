## Pathfinder Ministry

My personal goals around the Pathfinder ministry are:
- to help kids grow with friendship around God-centered people.
- for them to feel that they belong in the church family and that we wish them to grow into leadership roles in the church.
- for them to know that we are actively interested in their social and spiritual life.

In particular, I want my own kids to look back and view Pathfinders as an extension of our family life, so that one day they might pass the same sentiments to their own kids.

## Personal Life

Current goals in my personal life:
- raise and educate my children to be useful members of society and of the church.
- be a loving and caring husband to my wife.
- provide financial and emotional support to my family.
- be an effective member of my team at work.
- increase my level of physical fitness activities
- above all, to grow closed to God, trusting in Him more than before.
