## The Gospel of John
1. **John 1:1-28** Jesus is the Word of God, Creator of everything, Light of the World, Transformer of lives, and the Revelation of God. Jesus is unique.
2. **John 1:29-51** Jesus came to bring forgiveness, new life and the power of the Holy Spirit. Personal witness is effective. _"Come and see"_.
3. **John 2:1-25** Jesus wants to suprise us with joy, love and passion for God - in abundance. He wants to dwell in us. He wants to give us wisdom to use in our dealings and relationships.
4. **John 3:1-21** Jesus wants us to deal with confrontation with love and understanding. Jesus message is about transformation and faith in that which we cannot see. There is a God and his love is wide enough to embrace all humankind without distinction or exception.
5. **John 3:22-36** Jesus wants us to choose Him. Focus must never be in ourselves or our works but rather on Jesus.
6. **John 4:1-26** Jesus breaks down divisions of every kind and He is not interested in rivalry, fame or competiion. He does not discriminate between sexes, race or social classes.
7. **John 4:27-42** The most powerful way of passing on the message of Jesus is to tell people your story. A true encounter with Jesus transforms lives.
8. **John 4:43-5:15** Jesus wants to heal us. We should pray for the healing of others, as well as for ourselves. But we should always ask for God's will to be done. In this life our prayers for healing will not always be answered. Unanswered prayer can be a difficult and painful thing to wrestle with.
9. **John 5:16-30** Do the job that God has prepared for you instead of following your own plans. Listen to God. The evidence of a life of faith is a life of doing good. Seek to please God.
10. **John 5:31-47** Jesus is the source of life and studying the Bible is a way to grow your relationship with Him. Four witnesses testify about Jesus: people (like John the Baptist), the works in Jesus' life, the Father's testimony and the Scriptures. Each one must decide to come to Jesus of his free will.
11. **John 6:1-24** Faith grows by stretching. Know that God can do a lot with a little and provide beyond our imagination. Yet, we should be concious of material resources available to us and not be wasteful. Jesus helps us thru the storms of life.
12. **John 6:25-69** Jesus fill our spiritual hunger by providing us purpose, eternal life and forgiveness of sins. Our job is to believe.
13. **John 6:60-7:13** Following Jesus is not easy. Many are turned away or are offended by His teachings. But Jesus's words are spirit and life.
14. **John 7:14-44** Jesus wants to fill us with the Holy Spirit so we can bring life to those we encounter. 
15. **John 7:45-8:11** There is no condemnation for those who are in Jesus. Jesus does not condone sin but He pardons the sinner and asks us to leave our life of sin. When we judge, accuse and condemn others, we project on to them what we refuse to see in ourselves. 
16. **John 8:12-30** Our aim in life should be to please God. The model for our lives is to be with God and do everything with God and to please God.
17. **John 8:31-59** To know Jesus is to know the Truth and to know God. Everyone who sins is a slave to sin. In Jesus we are free from shame, addiction and fear. We are free to know God, to be ourselves and to love God and others.
18. **John 9:1-34** Jesus is our healer. Suffering is not necessarily the punishment for a particular sin, but a result of sin entering the world. Testimony of healing is powerful.
19. **John 9:35-10:21** Jesus came that we might enjoy life in abundance. Jesus is the door to the knowledge of God and we should listen to His voice. In Him we find purpose, fulfilment, peace and forgiveness.
20. **John 10:22-42** Jesus and the Father are one. When we believe, know and follow Jesus we have eternal life from God.
21. **John 11:1-44** Jesus has defeated death. The ressurection of Lazarus is a foretaste of that day when the dead shall rise to meet our Savior.
22. **John 11:45-12:11** Jesus brings peace in the mist of adversity. God used event the worst plots to bring about good. We can live in peace, knowing that God works for the good of those who live Him.
23. **John 12:12-36** Jesus is our King. Jesus defeated Satan not by military power, but by self-sacrifice. As King, we should serve Him with all our hearts.
24. **John 12:37-13:17** Jesus came to show us how to live a life of love, service, humility and forgiveness.
