# Education

When I first approached the book Education, by Ellen White, I was under the impression it was going to be basically about how to excel in academic studies using Bible principles. As soon as I started it became clear this book was going to be much more than that.

Ellen White approaches the concept of education as more than simply intellectual grow or preparation for a particular line of work. She broadens the concept to include every aspect of one's life and spanning one's entire lifetime. In this sense, we're always learning, always being educated.

True education is defined as the harmonious development of all faculties. A well-educated person would then be prepared to face the practical realities of life with grace and dignity, be them of a positive or negative nature.

The central focus of the book is on development of balanced, Christ-like character. The author emphasizes that mental, physical and spiritual development are equally needed and that the character forms by repetition and habit. Above all else, knowledge of God should be our primary goal, since, from that, all else can be derived. Human knowledge, for knowledge sake, is presented as being incomplete.

Practical examples and guidance are found for many different aspects of life and for how they affect the education of a human being, either for good or bad. Nature, sin and its consequences, the work of redemption, a family-centered system of education, school systems, and more.

The book deals with issues that are often neglected as part of education these days. Physiology, hygiene, diet, dressing, temperance, courtesy and recreation are presented to have great influence in one's education, more so than one would imagine from the standards set by society and schools these days.

Great emphasis is also given to the role of parents in the education of their children. Today many parents delegate much of the instruction of their children to teachers or nannies or schools. The author admits that these will cooperate with the work done by the parents, but she makes it undeniably clear that the primary responsibility falls to the parents. How different would society be today if more and more parents took this sacred responsibility more seriously.

The common thread across many of Ellen's books is present in Education: we must seek to be more like Christ, growing in character and education in order to provide our best service to God and man, and from this point of view, all other concepts and ideas take shape.
